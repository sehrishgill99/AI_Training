# Flower Classification using CNN

This Jupyter Notebook implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for flower image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. 

The project involves:
- Loading a dataset of flower images.
- Applying data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, zoom, and contrast adjustment.
- Building a CNN from scratch with convolution, pooling, and dense layers.
- Experimenting with transfer learning by using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to enhance performance.
- Training and validating the model over multiple epochs to achieve accurate flower classification.
